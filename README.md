# Carrot Kritters Web3 Responsive Website

I developed this website for 2 clients of "Carrot Kritters" that paid me to do so. I built this website fully responsive with all of the clients designs exactly how they wanted them. I used their art for 3 of the 5 sections which takes up most of the website, I added in a scroll function to the Navbar, I even added a Discord widget on the bottom of the website showing the clients discord and the amount of people in said discord and online at the time. If anyone would like to use this website for themselves they are going to have to use React to create a react app and pull down this repository and then use "npm install" to install the packages I have added below. (Forgive me if I miss some of them I did not plan to put this project on Github at first!) If I did miss some when you go to run the project it will throw an error and tell you what you're missing, you just have to install it and run it again.
